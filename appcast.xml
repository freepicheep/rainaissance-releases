            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Shortcuts Support and Raycast Support (pending approval)</h1>
<p>
    I've been wanting to build this release since I first had the idea of Rainaissance. Now you can automate rain and
    snow on your Mac using shortcuts, or, if you are a programmer, url schemes. This means you can make shortcuts that
    will automatically check the weather and start rain or snow based on current weather conditions. It is so fun and
    makes Rainaissance even more powerful and customizable.
    <br><br>
    I built the Raycast extension but it will need to be approved by the Raycast team before it is available. Keep your
    eyes open for it on the Raycast extension store over the next few days/weeks. It's very handy for controlling
    Rainaissance from your keyboard. It will include: (1) Toggle Rain/Snow, (2) Toggle Rain Sounds, (3) Change Rain
    Sound, and (4) Change Mode.

    v2.2.1 fixes a bug that was in v2.2.0.
